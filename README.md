This side project was inspired by chef Ping's family. Does this small project can help them? I hope so!

## Inspiration 
1. I bought their reunion delicate dishes since 2021. 
2. Before 2022, they used notebook to note orders in handwriting way.
3. 2023, his daughters used google spread sheet to help chef Ping to manage orders.
4. How to improve work process, that is the purpose of this project.

## Tools
- VS code

## Notes
